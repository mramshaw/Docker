# Docker

In terms of the __Cloud__, learning _Docker_ is a great first step.

All of the necessary concepts are present in Docker; cloud providers offer the same functionality (albeit in somewhat different forms) but the basics are all present in Docker.

Each cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) has multiple services, including VMs (Virtual Machines). They also provide (generally as a premium offering) Container services.

Various __orchestration__ services are available, but all of the cloud providers listed offer __Kubernetes__ (which is not to say that all of the offerings are identical - some lag behind).
